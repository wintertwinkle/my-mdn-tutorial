        This task has two images in boxes. 
        One image is smaller than the box, 
        the other is larger and breaking 
        out of the box. If you imagine that 
        the box is responsive and therefore 
        could grow and shrink, which property 
        would you apply to the image so that 
        the large image shrinks down into the 
        box but the small image does not stretch.
