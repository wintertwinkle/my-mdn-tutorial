# Responsive design note

## Historic website layouts

HTML is fundamentally responsive.

When browser window resize, the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the window.

This is called **liquid layout**.

As the mobile web started to become a reality with the first feature phones, companies who whised to embrace mobile would generally create a special mobile version of their site, with a different URL (often something like m.example.com, or example.mobi). This meant that two separate versions of the site had to be developed and kept up-to-date.

## Flexible layout before responsive design

In 2004 Cameron Adams wrote a post entitled [Resolution dependent layout](https://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2004/09/21/),describing a method of creating a design that could adapt to different screen resolutions. This approach required JavaScript to detect the screen resolution and load the correct CSS.
