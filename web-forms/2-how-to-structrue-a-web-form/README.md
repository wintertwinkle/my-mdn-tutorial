# How to structure a web form

## The `<form>` element

The `<form>` element formally defines a form and attributes that determine the form's behavior.

## The `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements

The `<fieldset>` element is a convenient way to create `groups` of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic purposes.

In general the `<fieldset>` element can also be used to section a form.

## The `<label>` element

The `<label>` element is the formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget.

## Common HTML structures used with forms

As you can see in the examples, it's common practice to wrap a label and its widget with a `<li>` element within a `<ul>` or `<ol>` list. `<p>` and `<div>` elements are also commonly used. Lists are recommended for structuring multiple checkboxes or radio buttons.

In addition to the `<fieldset>` element, it's also common practice to use HTML titles (e.g. `<h1>`, `<h2>`) and sectioning (e.g. `<section>`) to structure complex forms.
