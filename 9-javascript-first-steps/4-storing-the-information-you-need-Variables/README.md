# Storing the information you need — Variables

## What is a variable?

A variable is a container for a value.

Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers for values.

You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.

## Declaring a variable

变量声明：

造一个空盒子，空盒子里啥都没有 (`undefined`)

## Initializing a variable

初始化变量：

造一个空盒子，往里面装一个东西

## When to use const and when to use let

Use const when you can, and use let when you have to.

能用 `const` 就用 `const`
